# MERN-APP Starter

By [Daniel Yoo](https://kympanic.github.io/)

Check out the live site [here](https://mern-app-starter.onrender.com/)

This MERN stack application is ready for deployment to Render. It has user authentication,authorization and forms for logging in and out. The project was a great refresher course from what I've learned at App Academy and helped me learn a NoSQL database like MongoDB. This no-fuss application was created as a basic template to easily create fullstack applications.
